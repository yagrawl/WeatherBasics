This is a basic NodeJS application that uses request and yargs modules from the NodeJs library.
It also uses APIs from openweather.org and ipinfo.io to obtain data for the application to function. 
The app basically returns the current temperature at a location if provided as an argument. 
If the location is not provided then the app uses the IP address to guesstimate a location of the user
and provides the weather of that region.
